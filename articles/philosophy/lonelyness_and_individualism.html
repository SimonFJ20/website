<h1>Lonelyness and Individualism</h1>
<span>Simon From Jakobsen &lt;simonfromjakobsen@gmail.com&gt;, 9. December 2023</span>

<p><b>
        Increasing lonelyness has become a fact in modern society.
        Friend groups decrease in size.
        Less people are able to find partners.
        Deep relationships become increasingly rare.
        Relationships at work are generally confined to corporate friendlyness-relations, rather than relations of
        friendship.
        Modern society inspires acts with consequences of loneliness and makes it increasingly difficult to socialize
        with new people.
