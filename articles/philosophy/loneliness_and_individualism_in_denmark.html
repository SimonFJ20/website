<h1>(WIP) Loneliness and Individualism in Denmark</h1>

<p><b>
    Increasing loneliness has become a fact in modern society. Friend groups decrease in size. Less people are able to find partners. Deep relationships become increasingly rare. Relationships at work are generally confined to corporate friendlyness-relations, rather than relations of friendship. Modern society inspires acts with consequences of loneliness and makes it increasingly difficult to socialize with new people. What causes this loneliness and how should we combat it?

<b>Alienating labor</b>

<p>
    Under capitalism many workers produce products which they will neither use nor own after production. The work done also doesn't benefit the community, rather it's primary purpose is to generate wealth for the employer. This means that most people spend at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on work that is neither directly for the good of themselves nor the good of their community. Workers do this not because they want to, but because their lifes depend on the wage they're paid. In modern capitalist society people who do not own capital are required to spend a large part of their life doing work which will neither benefit themselves or their community. Unwillingness to participate in wage labor will have enormous consequences on a persons life and their freedoms.[1]

</p>

<p>
    This alionation of workers has severe consequences for the lives of workers. Workers develop a sense of meaninglessness with the work they are doing. The work becomes nothing but a means to an end; to keep on existing as a worker. Since the relationship of the worker to the work becomes a means to an end, so does the relationship of the worker to other workers. The relationship of coworkers are therefore mostly confined to corporate relations rather than personal relations.

<b>Competition of workers</b>

<p>
    Under capitalism workers are in constant competition. TODO: explain why
</p>

<p>
    This competition causes an inherent hostility in the relationship of workers in a capitalist organization. This makes genuine relationships more difficult and make workers emotionally seperated and isolated from other workers. This also means that when a worker is not at work, they generally do not care about most of their coworkers, instead friendliness with cowerkers is more a part of the work rather than personal relationships.

<b>Individualism</b>
