<h1>(WIP) Loneliness and Individualism in Denmark</h1>

<p><b>
    Increasing loneliness has become a fact in modern society. Friend groups decrease in size. Less people are able to find partners. Deep relationships become increasingly rare. Relationships at work are generally confined to corporate friendlyness-relations, rather than relations of friendship. Modern society inspires acts with consequences of loneliness and makes it increasingly difficult to socialize with new people. What causes this loneliness and how should we combat it?

<b>Alienating labor</b>

<p>
    Under capitalism many workers produce products which they will neither use nor own after production. The work done also doesn't benefit the community, rather it's primary purpose is to generate wealth for the employer. This means that most people spend at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on work that is neither directly for the good of themselves nor the good of their community. Workers do this not because they want to, but because their lifes depend on the wage they're paid. In modern capitalist society people who do not own capital are required to spend a large part of their life doing work which will neither benefit themselves or their community. Unwillingness to participate in wage labor will have enormous consequences on a persons life and their freedoms.[1]

    TODD: Compare a worker living under capitalism to that of a worker living in a utopian hypothetical agricultural commune.

    In a capitalist society, as worker will spend maybe around 1 to 2 hours travelling to and from work, then spend 8 hours at work. The worker will do this 5 days a week for the majority of the year. Let's say they work in a chair factory. The worker will spend the 8 hours assembling chairs. When a chair is assembled, it is not the worker's chair, it is the property of the employer, who themselves choose what to do with it. It doesn't matter whether the worker assembles chairs, shovels coal, or programs electronic curcuits, they just have to spend the 8 hours doing it, meaning the work itself isn't for the benifit of the worker, it's for the employer. After 8 hours of labor, the worker has achieved nothing, except avoided getting fired. If the worker can avoid getting fired all the way to the end of the month, the worker recieves a wage. This wage is the minimum amount which the employer needs to pay the worker, for the worker to live. When the worker with their wage has paid all their expenses, they will not have earned anything, they will only have sustained their ability to work. This means the worker will spent 10 hours 5 days a week on sustaining the very fact that they spent 10 hours 5 days a week working and achieving nothing.

    Let's compare this to an average citizen, still worker, in a utopian hypothetical agricultural commune society, which I will call society X. The worker owns their place of living, no loan, no rent. This means the worker doesn't pay for anything they do not consume directly. The worker owns a field and some field equipments together with a few other citizens. They together spend 8 hours a day 5 days a week working in the field. The worker also spends 2 hours gathering firewood in the forest. When the worker gets home, they will have spend the day gathering firewood <b>for himself to consume</b>, they will have spend the day preparing crops for some time in the future <b>for himself to consume</b>. No employer will take what the worker has produced that day. The worker has worked for himself. The worker understands that the gathering of firewood is neccesary for the worker to light a fire at night. The worker understands that the work in the field is neccesary for securing food in the future. The work the worker does is for himself the worker, not for someone else.
</p>

<p>
    This alionation of workers has severe consequences for the lives of workers. Workers develop a sense of meaninglessness with the work they are doing. The work becomes nothing but a means to an end; to keep on existing as a worker. Since the relationship of the worker to the work becomes a means to an end, so does the relationship of the worker to other workers. The relationship of coworkers are therefore mostly confined to corporate relations rather than personal relations. 
</p>

<b>Competition of workers</b>

<p>
    Under capitalism workers are in constant competition. TODO: explain why
</p>

<p>
    When the worker is at work, they're of course friendly with their coworkers. But there are contradictions present in this relationship. If the worker or any of their coworkers work too slowly or too little, they will be replaced with a new coworker. The workers also amongst themselves compete for higher wages than their peers. When budget cuts inevitable arise for the employer, the employer will have to select which workers get to stay, and which workers get to find a new job somewhere else. This 'new job somewhere else' might be in the factory next door, it might be in next the city, or it might not exist at all; it puts the workers living conditions in jeopardy. These and some other factors cause competition between workers.
</p>

<p>
    This competition causes an inherent hostility in the relationship of workers in a capitalist organization. This makes genuine relationships more difficult and make workers emotionally seperated and isolated from other workers. This also means that when a worker is not at work, they generally do not care about most of their coworkers, instead friendliness with cowerkers is more a part of the work rather than personal relationships.
</p>

<p>
    Compare this to the workers on the field in society X. All the workers in the field know the work they're doing, is essential to securing food for themselves. They know that they're all dependent on each other. They have to work together, else they will not have food in the future. There is no inherent competition between the workers. If one worker works slower or less than the others, the others will confront that worker. Naturally the workers will not be equal in their capacity to work, but they understand this. This interdependence and mutual understanding will create a strong relations between the workers. They have no reason to compete with each other. They know that the better they are at working together, the better the outcome. This will also promote far better communication between workers than in the example above.[2]
