                <td><b>н</b> equates to an N as in <b>n</b>iet, the Russian word for “no” (you might have heard it before in a Hollywood movie about Russia). By now you’ll be able to read it in Cyrillic: нет!</td>

                <td><b>х</b> resembles the sound you make in the back of your throat in the word “lo<b>ch</b>” (in traditional Scottish English). It’s also the same sound found in Buch in German.</td>

                <td><b>п</b> surely makes you think of <b>pi</b>, whatever your level of math. It sounds like the P in <b>P</b>ushkin.</td>

                <td>и</td>
                <td><b>и</b> sounds like the I in <b>I</b>gor. Most native English speakers will more likely associate this letter with an E sound, like in “s<b>ee</b>,” or an “ie” sound, like in “p<b>ie</b>ce.”</td>

                <td>Short I</td>
                <td>Й</td>
                <td>й</td>
                <td><b>й</b> sounds more or less like the sound Y in toy. When combined with an E, you get “eй” (as in “h<b>ey</b>”), with an O, you have “oй” (as in Bolsh<b>oi</b>) and with an A, you get “aй” (as in “<b>ay</b>e”).</td>

                <td>Ы</td>
                <td>ы</td>
                <td><b>ы</b> is quite a difficult sound for English speakers to reproduce. It’s pronounced a bit like an I that comes from the throat. Russians understand the difficulty this letter causes and won’t hold it against you if you pronounce it like a normal I at first.</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Щ</td>
                <td>щ</td>
                <td><b>щ</b> is a soft “shch” sound that does not exist in English. To pronounce it properly, you must brace your tongue downwards, a bit like the pronunciation of the German word ich.</td>

                <td>Я</td>
                <td>я</td>
                <td><b>я</b> is a “ya” sound, as in “<b>ya</b>rd” or the Siberian city of <b>Ya</b>kutsk, which is also the coldest city in the world (-40°C on average in January).</td>

                <td><b>ь</b> is what we call the <b>soft sign</b>. It’s not pronounced on its own, but it softens the pronunciation of the letter preceding it.</td>
